            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Here are some of my favorite hobbies and activities.</p>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Playing video games - I enjoy diving into a variety of genres to suit my mood. </li>
                    <p>I particularly love first-person shooters like CS2 and Valorant for their adrenaline rush and stragetic gameplay, or Insurgency(2014) and Battlefield for more slow-paced experience.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, I also plays some zombie games such as Left 4 Dead and No More Room in Hell for their survival elements, and sandbox games like Minecraft that allow creative freedom and exploration.</p>
                    <p>When I'm looking for something more relaxed, I turn to casual games such as Stardew Valley or Power Wash Simulator that offer a pleasant distraction without requiring intense focus or time commitment.</p>
                <li>Programming - A passion of mine, primarily driven by the joy of creating and exploring my own capabilities through personal projects.</li>
                    <p>I love diving into coding challenges just for fun, experimenting with different languages and frameworks to see what I can build. Whether it's a quirky utility script in Python, a small web application using JavaScript, or a game project using C# in Unity, my motivation comes from the excitement of turning an idea into a working solution.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy pushing my boundaries, learning new technologies, and discovering the extent of my programming skills through personal side projects that challenge and inspire me. </p>
